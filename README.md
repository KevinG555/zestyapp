# ZestyApp - Code Institute Milestone Project #

## Overview ##
This app is created in Python and Flask

## UX ##

This website was created with the intention to store and easily share recipes. The home page shows the recipes categories and when clicked on the images can get information about preparation, cook time and for how many people. Also when clicked on the link in each card brings to related category where users can get about ingredients and directions. The menu preparation time differs from 10 mins to 120 mins and there are categories as;

* Sandwiches
* Pasta
* Vegetarian
* Cake

## Features ##
* Any recipe can added according to their categories, names, preparation time, cook time, igredients and directions whilst uploading image in jpeg.
* It can be navigated eitherby clicking on the cards or a category can be chosen from the navigation bar "Recipe Categories" tab.

## Features to implement ##
 * Videos - The ability to attach videos to the recipes so that the users can upload video instructions for their recipes or the can embed links.

* Blog - The users can get updates,stories and feedback from users of the applications.
* Social Media reviews from the users.

## Technologies Used ##

* [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)

  A modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design
 
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 
  
  Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.
  You can learn to use Python and see almost immediate gains in productivity and lower maintenance costs.
  
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

  MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing.
  
  * MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be         changed over time

  * The document model maps to the objects in your application code, making data easy to work with

  * Ad hoc queries, indexing, and real time aggregation provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data

  * MongoDB is a distributed database at its core, so high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution are built in and     easy to use

  * MongoDB is **free and open-source.** 
  
  [mLab](https://mlab.com)
  
  mLab is a fully managed cloud database service featuring automated provisioning and scaling of MongoDB databases, backup and recovery,     24/7 monitoring and alerting, web-based management tools, and expert support. mLab's Database-as-a-Service platform powers hundreds of     thousands of databases across AWS, Azure, and Google and allows developers to focus their attention on product development instead of     operations.

  Since its inception seven years ago, mLab has grown like wildfire and now manages over 900,000 databases across three major cloud         providers in 43 datacenters worldwide.
  
  [Flask-PyMongo](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-PyMongo/)
  
  MongoDB is an open source database that stores flexible JSON-like “documents,” which can have any number, name, or hierarchy of fields     within, instead of rows of data as in a relational database. Python developers can think of MongoDB as a persistent, searchable           repository of Python dictionaries (and, in fact, this is how PyMongo represents MongoDB documents). Flask-PyMongo bridges Flask and       PyMongo and provides some convenience helpers.
  
  [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
  
  Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages. Heroku, one of the first cloud platforms, has been in   development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure,         Python, PHP, and Go.
  
  [Git](https://github.com/) :octocat:
  
  GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It is used for the version       control.
  
  [Cloud 9](https://c9.io)
  
  AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser.   It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal.
  
  
  ## Deployment ##
  
  1.Install "reqirements.txt" file with the command;
  
   ```
   pip3 freeze --local requirements.txt
   ```
   
  2.Create "Procfile" with the command;
  ```
  echo web: python app.py > Procfile
  ```
  
  3.Via Linux Terminal, login to Heroku,
  ```
  heroku login
  ```
  
   Input Heroku login details and connect to Heroku.
  
  4.Create new Heroku app using command;
   ```
    heroku apps:create appname 
   ```
  
  5.Before pushing to Heroku;
  
  ```
   git init .
   git add .
   git commit -m "explanation note" .
   git push heroku master
   ```
  
  6.Create scale, with command;
   ```
   heroku ps:scale web=1
   ```
  
  7.Select settings from heroku and then select 
    ```
   ‘Reveal Config'. Add IP 0.0.0.0 and PORT 5000.
    ```
